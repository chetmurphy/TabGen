	<h2>Installing TabGen</h2>
	<p>To install TabGen, simply copy its files into the appropriate 
	directory on your computer. The process is detailed <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-install-an-ADD-IN-and-Script-in-Fusion-360.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that TabGen is an 
	add-in, not a script. The files that need to be copied are the ones in the distribution zip 
	file. Once its files have been copied to the right place, TabGen will be available from Fusion 
	360&rsquo;s Modify menu the next time Fusion 360 is started.</p>
