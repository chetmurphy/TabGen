	<h1>Help for the TabGen Fusion 360 Add-In</h1>
	
	<h2>What is TabGen?</h2>
    <p>In designs intended to have their parts laser cut from sheet material,
	it&rsquo;s common to use &ldquo;finger-joints&rdquo; to connect parts to one another. 
	It&rsquo;s not hard to add the cuts for finger-joints to the edges of parts in Fusion 360, 
	but it <i>is</i> tedious. After doing so a bunch of times, I decided to write this add-in 
	&ndash; TabGen &ndash; to automate the process. TabGen is free software distributed under 
	GNU General Public License version 3 or later. See <a href="./readme.html">readme.html</a> 
	for details and for installation instructions.</p>
	
	<p>This is the first version of TabGen. Though I think I&rsquo;ve tested it pretty well, 
	I'm sure 1there are bugs in it. Feedback on any problems you encounter would be most 
	welcome. Similarly, there are no doubt improvements that could be made. Let me know what 
	you&rsquo;d like to see added or changed.</p>

	<p>Speaking of changes, the one I&rsquo;d most like is to have TabGen work smoothly with fully
	parameterized designs. That is, to have already-cut joints automatically adjust as necessary 
	when user parameters are changed. So far, I haven't quite gotten there. At the end of this 
	write-up I&rsquo;ve included some technical details of the stumbling block I&rsquo;ve 
	encountered	in the hope an expert in the API might help put me on the right track.</p>

	<h2>Using TabGen</h2>
	<p>To use TabGen, select it from the Modify menu.</p>

	<img src="./ss1.png">

	<p>This brings up the TabGen dialog used to specify where the finger joints should be made, how 
	big the tabs and gaps should be, the thickness of the material to be cut, and whether the
	finger-joints along the selected face(s) should start with a tab or a gap.</p>

	<img src="./ss2.png">

	<p>Next, select the faces on which the tabs and gaps are to be cut. You can select any number 
	of faces to be cut in a single pass.</p>

	<img src="ss3.png">

	<p>With the faces selected and the other parameters adjusted to your needs, click on the 
	&ldquo;Ok&rdquo; button. This causes TabGen to cut tabs in all of the selected faces.</p>

	<img src="ss4.png">

	<p>TabGen will only cut tabs and gaps on rectangular faces with one dimension equal to the 
	specified material thickness and a length that&rsquo;s at least long enough to cut one 
	complete finger-joint. If you select a face that can&rsquo;t be cut, an error message will 
	display in the dialog box explaining what&rsquo;s wrong, and you won&rsquo;t be able to 
	click the &ldquo;Ok&rdquo; button.</p>

	<h2>On supporting parameterized models</h2>
	<p>As I mentioned above, I&rsquo;d like to support parameterized models in TabGen, but I 
	haven&rsquo;t figured out how to do it.</p>
	
	<p>The fundamental problem I&rsquo;ve encountered is that in a parameterized model, the 
	dimensions of a face into which finger-joint cuts are to be made depend on some unknown 
	function of some unknown set of user-defined parameters. Since the location, number of 
	cuts and cut depth can all change when the face dimensions change, I need to specify all 
	of that using expression properties in things like ModelParameter objects associated with OffsetConstraint objects. That would be possible if I could refer to other ModelParameter 
	objects in expressions, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
	
	<p>For example, the number of gaps to be cut along a face is floor(faceLength / (2 * tabWidth)). 
	I need that number to create a rectangular pattern with the correct number of cuts. But 
	faceLength is some unknown function of some unknown user parameters, so how do I specify it 
	in an expression? I got pretty close but not all the way there.</p>
	
	<p>I can create a driven SketchDimension object on the face that's equal to faceLength. That 
	SketchDimension has a ModelParameter associated with it and that ModelParameter has a value 
	property with the correct contents and its contents are appropriately updated as user 
	parameters are adjusted. But using the name of a ModelParameter in an expression (as you would 
	the name of a UserParameter) generates an error. Sigh.</p>
	
	<p>I&rsquo;m pretty much out of ideas, and a question I posted on the Fusion 360 API forum has gotten 
	no responses. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
